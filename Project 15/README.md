# Age Verification with Computer Vision  
**Good Seed Supermarket — Alcohol Sales Compliance Project**  

---

## Project Overview  
Good Seed, a supermarket chain, is exploring ways to ensure legal compliance with alcohol sales laws by leveraging Data Science and Computer Vision. The objective of this project is to develop and evaluate a machine learning model that can accurately estimate a person’s age based on a photograph. This technology will help prevent alcohol sales to underage individuals by integrating automated age verification at checkout points.

---

## Project Objectives  
✔️ Analyze photographic data with labeled ages  
✔️ Train and evaluate a neural network model for age estimation  
✔️ Ensure the model performs reliably using Computer Vision techniques  
✔️ Provide conclusions on model performance to assist in decision-making for real-world implementation
